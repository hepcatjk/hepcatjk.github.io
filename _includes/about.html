     My research develops the foundations of changing the current architectural design, construction, and operational practices through modeling, simulation, and training. I strive to understand the impact the built environment has on humans; and conversely how humans impact the built environment. This is a complex problem that transcends disciplinary boundaries. My research introduces computational methods to make buildings more energy-efficient while keeping humans-in-the-loop. I introduce a first principle physics-based approach to energy and light simulation that produces more informed design choices and therefore better performing buildings, retrofitting, and cities.</p><BR>

     <p class="para">I am the co-Director of the <a href="https://sdl.eecs.ucf.edu/"><b>SENSEable Design Lab</b></a> at the Institute for Simulation and Training in the School for Modeling, Simulation, and Training which is a transdisciplinary lab researching responsive sustainable design theory. I study how emerging <i>Augmented Reality</i> (AR) and <i>Building Information Modeling</i> (BIM) technologies can be integrated to increase human performance by improving the retraining of construction workers for retrofitting and repurposing buildings. Here we develop, validate, and test simulation methods utilizing complex capture methods, illumination simulations, and spectral rendering to improve design solutions for building energy use and occupant comfort.  This research requires an <i>anti-disciplinary</i> approach that combines the best of disciplinary knowledge and processes from computer science, architecture, psychology, and engineering to innovate new knowledge and approaches.</p><BR>

     <p class="para">I had the pleasure to be mentored by <a href="http://www.graphics.cornell.edu/people/director"><b>Donald Greenberg</b></a> as a Research Associate and Post-Doctoral Fellow at <a href="http://www.cornell.edu/">Cornell University</a> in the <a href="http://www.graphics.cornell.edu/">Program of Computer Graphics</a>.

While at Penn, I ran the <a href="http://cg.cis.upenn.edu/">SIG Center for Computer Graphics</a> serving as the Associate Director for three years. I also was a lecturer in the <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/index.php">Department of Computer and Information Science</a>.
