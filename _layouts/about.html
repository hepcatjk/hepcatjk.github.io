<p class="para">I am an Associate Professor in the <a href="https://www.clemson.edu/cecas/departments/computing/index.html"><b>School of Computing</b></a> at <a href="https://www.clemson.edu/"><b>Clemson University</b></a> located in Charleston, South Carolina (<a href="https://www.clemson.edu/innovation-campuses/charleston/index.html"><b>Charleston Innovation Campus</b></a>). I work in the <a href="https://computing.clemson.edu/vcl/"><b>Visual Computing</b></a> research division which focuses on the acquisition, processing, and synthesis of visual information. I teach in the <a href="https://www.cs.clemson.edu/dpa/"><b>Digital Production Arts</b></a> program, where I work with students to explore cutting-edge technical and artistic components of visual effects production. From 2016-2024 I was an Associate Professor at the <a href="https://www.ist.ucf.edu/"><b>IST, School of Modeling, Simulation, and Training</b></a> at the <a href="https://www.ucf.edu/"><b>University of Central Florida</b></a> located in Orlando, Florida. I held a Secondary Joint Appointment in the <a href="https://www.cs.ucf.edu/"><b>Department of Computer Science</b></a> and in the <a href="https://www.ucf.edu/research/learning-sciences/"><b>Learning Sciences Faculty Cluster</b></a>. I also co-directed (with Lori Walters) the <a href="https://sdl.eecs.ucf.edu/"><b>SENSEable Design Laboratory</b></a> at the Institute for Simulation and Training.</p><br>



<p class="para">My research focuses on <b>computer graphics</b>, <b>virtual reality</b>, <b>augmented reality</b>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ucf.tapemeasure/"><b>human-robotic teams</b></a>, and <b>human-computer interaction</b>. This trans-disciplinary research utilizes <b>computer graphics</b> and computational tools to design virtual environments, cutting-edge hardware, and technology to design novel research settings, and elements of cognitive and experimental psychology to rigorously study learning and performance of individuals and teams. This approach requires an “anti-disciplinary” methodology combining disciplinary knowledge and processes from Computer Science, Architecture, Psychology, and Engineering to innovate new knowledge, experimental approaches, and novel validation processes. This research also strongly impacts <a href="https://sciences.ucf.edu/anthropology/datch/"><b>immersive technologies</b></a> for <b>Cultural Heritage</b>. This connects work at the intersection of digital technologies and the digital humanities focusing on realistic (spectral) rendering, <a href="https:https://chronopoints.eecs.ucf.edu/"><b>digitally documenting</b></a> historically significant structures and artifacts, and virtual environments. As a result of my wide range of interests, I can collaborate easily with colleagues and build diverse teams. My team’s work has won national and international recognition through publications, grants, and awards in each research theme. My research has been awarded
 ~$7.5 million dollars - always in teams of amazing collaborators.</p><BR>

This has evolved along the following research themes and questions:
