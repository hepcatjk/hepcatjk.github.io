<img src="../imgs/class/ids6938teaser.png" width="100%"><br>

Recent advancements in computer technology allow building performance simulation to be a central part of the design process. This course focuses on basic and advanced building performance simulation methods and their underlying principles. 
We will look at simulations that impact energy, thermal, and visual comfort with a strong emphasis on building simulation tools. Innovative techniques on how to use these models in a building's design will be explored. This course will provide students intuition on how we code and design virtual environments, and how these virtual environments end up changing our understanding of a future physical environment. 
This class is set up as an interdisciplinary seminar with a strong focus on a variety of backgrounds: computer science, human factors, applied mathematics, architecture, smart building design and electrical engineering.

<img src="../imgs/class/ids6145teaser.png" width="100%"><br>
Modeling and Simulation is important in many application domains from engineering to nursing. How do we design an engaging virtual environment for training? Or model how a human and robot interact to jointly solve a task? Can we make buildings more sustainable or apply machine learning to solve challenging problems in understanding the human brain? The objective of this course is to provide a broad survey of three different categories of simulation: discrete event simulation, continuous simulation, and agent-based simulation. Material in this course will provide an overview of the foundations as well as specific example problems and simulation solutions for each category of simulation. Students will be expected to understand the basics for a variety of different types of simulations, as well as to work with hands-on simulation tools to implement solutions various problems. To fully investigate this new technology, there will be three projects - one for each category of simulation.

<li><B>CS 4654: Design in Virtual Reality</B> (co-listed as an Architecture Studio) (Spring 2016)<BR><BR>

Design in Virtual Reality was organized as a design studio with collaboration between teams of architectural designers and computer science majors. This course investigated <i>Virtual Reality</i> under the lens of multiple disciplines (visual perception, digital photography, modeling, geometry capture, color science, display technology and computer graphics). This course dove into deep questions: How do we design a virtual environment, and how does this fully virtual environment end up changing our understanding of a future physical environment? Potential design subjects include architectural (spatial) design, product (object) design, perception experiments, medical applications, and the development and use of new graphics algorithms. A major question to be answered is whether existing real-time graphics algorithms can be used in these future immersive environments. A major thrust of the course will be to identify those areas in virtual and augmented reality systems which need to be improved to make the systems more suitable for everyday use. Current implementations do not satisfy the current demands but the concepts and potential improvements will open up new possibilities. This course recieved hardware donations from Valve, Occulus, NVIDIA, and Microsoft.

<h3><img src="../imgs/university/penn.svg" height="50"> University of Pennsylvania</h3>
I taught three classes during grad school at Penn. I was a Lecturer for the Department of Computer
and Information Science (CIS) for the 2011-2012 school year teaching a full course load (4 courses). From 2008-2011,
I served as a Part-time Lecturer for CIS teaching roughly 2-3 courses a year.

In 2010, I was awarded <B>The Penn Prize for Excellence in Teaching</B> by Graduate Students.<BR><BR>

<li><B>CIS 565: GPU Programming and Architecture</B><BR><BR>
This course examines the architecture and capabilities of modern GPUs (graphics processing unit). The GPU has grown in power over recent years, to the point where many computations can be performed faster on the GPU than on a traditional CPU. GPUs have also become programmable, allowing them to be used for a diverse set of applications far removed from traditional graphics. A timely selection from the following topics: GPU hardware, CUDA, massively parallel algorithms, graphics pipeline, real-time rendering, 3D engine architecture, asset formats, OpenGL, OpenGL ES, WebGL, and mobile GPUs. THis was a project intensive course with significant coding. (The course is still currently taught and popular at Penn instructed by first year cis665 alumni Patrick Cozzi! - I love and very proud that a past student has taken over the course and done wonderful things with it after I left Penn.)

This course explores physically based simulation methods for computer animation of a wide variety of phenomena and materials including rigid and deformable solids, cloth, liquids, virtual characters, and explosions. Students will be introduced to numerical methods, physical models, data structures, and theoretical results which form the building blocks of these methods. To gain hands-on experience, students will implement basic simulators for several phenomena.

The senior capstone design project provides an opportunity to define, design, and execute a project of the student's own choosing. Students gain experience
working in a team, including division of labor and responsibilities, integration of work, interpersonal communication, etc. Students identifying a computer graphics-related problem and potential solutions. Many projects from this course culminated in publishing, including two undergraduates winning a Best Paper award
at the International Symposium on Virtual Reality, Archaeology and Cultural Heritage (VAST), 2009.
