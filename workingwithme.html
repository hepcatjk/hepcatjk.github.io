            <h4>Thank you for your interest in my group!</h4>

        	           
           In general, I run a lab with a variety of students from different disciplinary expertise - I have students from Computer Science, Modeling & Simulation, Architecture, Psychology, Human Factors, Engineering working on transdisciplinary problems that require people from all walks of life (all levels). Our group is always looking for highly motivated students. Please contact me if you are interested in working in the <a href="https://sdl.eecs.ucf.edu/"><b>SENSEable Design Laboratory</b></a>, <a href="https://chronopoints.eecs.ucf.edu/"><b>the ChronoPoints Project</b></a>, or you just need my help on a committee.<BR>
