         <h4>Thank you for your interest in my group!</h4>
           I run a lab with a variety of students from different disciplinary expertise - I have students from <b>Computer Science</b>, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Architecture, Psychology, Human Factors, and Modeling & Simulation working on transdisciplinary problems that require people from all walks of life (and all academic levels). Our group is <b>always looking for highly motivated students</b>. Please contact me if you are interested in working in the <a href="https://sdl.eecs.ucf.edu/"><b>Pixel Laboratory</b></a>, <a href="https://chronopoints.eecs.ucf.edu/"><b>the ChronoPoints Project</b></a>, or you just need my help on a committee.<BR>

            <h4>PhD Students</h4>
            Our group is always looking for highly motivated and talented Ph.D. students so, if you are interested, I encourage you to apply to the PhD program at the <a href="https://www.clemson.edu/cecas/departments/computing/academics/graduates/degrees/phd-cs.html"><b>School of Computing</b></a> which is part of the <a href="https://www.clemson.edu/"><b>Clemson University</b></a>. I work in Visual Computing, a highly interdisciplinary program focusing on the acquisition, processing, and synthesis of visual information in the broad areas of computer graphics, visualization, perception, robotics, virtual/augmented reality, and cultural heritage. NOTE that the application will ask you to name the faculty members you may be interested in working with, so if I'm one of them do make sure to mention my name in your application. <BR><BR>
            I am extremely passionate about research and I find great joy in my work, so group culture / teamwork means a lot to me. I am looking for students from diverse backgrounds, diverse displines - who are hard-working, inquisitive, passionate, collaborative, and kind.<BR><BR>

There are <a href="https://www.clemson.edu/centers-institutes/watt/creative-inquiry/"><b>many great programs</b></a> at Clemson - (Clemson University Creative Inquiry Program, etc.). Often these programs provide funding to students. I encourage all of my Ph.D .students and Postdocs to work with undergrads.<BR><BR>

             <h4>Postdocs</h4>
