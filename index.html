                                <p class="custom_about"> I am an Assistant Professor at the <a href="http://www.ist.ucf.edu/">Institute for Simulation and Training</a> at the <a href="http://www.ucf.edu/">University of Central Florida </a> in Orlando, Florida. I am orginally from Philadelphia.
                    </p>
                <p class="custom_about">My current research focuses on the transdisciplinary digital design of smart sustainable architecture. I work on high dimensional light transport problems, such as complex illumination, material appearance, physically-based simulation, and spectral rendering, which facilitate a unique approach to provide both more accurate simulations and efficient algorithms for simulating sustainable architecture and smart buildings. I research advanced numeric simulations that derive a building’s daylighting behavior, thermal performance, and material properties. I develop novel approaches for simulating, manipulating, and physically realizing sustainable designs in all phases of a building’s lifecycle. This research directly impacts smart-building design, smart-cities, early-stage design, and retrofitting buildings.</p>
                <p class="custom_about">I had the pleasure to be mentored by <a href="http://www.graphics.cornell.edu/people/director.html">Donald Greenberg</a> as a Research Associate and Post-Doctoral Fellow at <a href="http://www.cornell.edu/">Cornell University</a> in the <a href="http://www.graphics.cornell.edu/">Program of Computer Graphics</a>. I completed my Ph.D. at the <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/index.php">Department of Computer and Information Science</a>, <a href="http://www.upenn.edu/">University of Pennsylvania</a>, where I was advised by <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~badler/">Norman Badler</a>. While at Penn, I ran the <a href="http://cg.cis.upenn.edu/">SIG Center for Computer Graphics</a> serving as the Associate Director for three years. I also was a full lecturer in the <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/index.php">Department of Computer and Information Science</a>. I had the pleasure of teaching and advising the amazing students in Penn's <a href="http://cg.cis.upenn.edu/dmd_program.html">Digital Media Design</a> Undergraduate Program and <a href="http://cg.cis.upenn.edu/cggt_program.html">Computer Graphics and Game Technology</a> Master Program.</p>
