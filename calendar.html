           In general, I marginally prefer morning meetings over afternoon meetings. I am typically in the office between 8:00a and gone most evenings by 5:30p. (        and typically back online by 8:15pm +). Although Friday meetings are possible, I strongly prefer to leave Friday meeting-free if I can. My office is         in Partnership II, room 140B.<BR><BR>
